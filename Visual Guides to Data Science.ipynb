    "As you probably have seen in our [Learn Data Science Infographic](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/learn-data-science-infographic), statistics is one of the fundamental topics when you're learning data science. For some, this topic can prove quite the challenge. Luckily, there are some websites, books and infographics that represent statistics visually, which makes this hard topic quite accessible for anybody! \n",
