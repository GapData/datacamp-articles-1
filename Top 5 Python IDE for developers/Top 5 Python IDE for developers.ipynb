    "IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It's a coding tool which allows you to write, test and debug your code in a easier way. It's a very broad concept and might confuse you about which IDE you should use. The truth is that you can coding in almost any software, from prompt command to Windows notepad, but you may also want a proper place which combines coding facility with a debugging environment.\n",

    "You may wondering why you should use an IDE instead of your Windows notepad, for example, and here is the answer: practicality. For instance, imagine that you are coding in any text editor like Windows notepad. When your code be ready, you'll need to run it. You can't execute your program in a text editor like this, so you must use a prompt command to do it. Rather than use two different programs, wouldn't better have it all in just one place? That's what an IDE is ready for."

You can easily see and explore what you are creating, either by inspecting variable's values and interacting with plots and data frames. For free, Rodeo is available for Windows, Linux and Mac. "
