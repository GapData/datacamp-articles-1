    "IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It's a coding tool which allows you to write, test and debug your code in a easier way. It's a very broad concept that may confuse you about which IDE you should use. The truth is that you can write code in almost any software, from prompt command to Windows notepad, but you also may want a proper place that combine coding facility and debugging environment.\n",

    "You may wondering why you should use an IDE instead of your Windows notepad, and here is the answer: practicality. For instance, imagine that you are coding in any text editor like Windows notepad. When your code be ready, you'll need to run it. You can't run your program in a text editor like this one, so you may use a prompt command to do it. Rather than use two different programs, wouldn't better have it all in just one place? That's what an IDE is ready for."

Options like the <a href='https://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-plugins/files/DBGP%20Plugin/'>DBGP for Notepad++</a> install a debugger in the application, allowing you to run and analyse your code directly in your favorite text editor.
