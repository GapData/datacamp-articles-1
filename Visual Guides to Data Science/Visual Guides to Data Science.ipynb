Or, alternatively, if you already master concepts, visual representations are just funny to look at and can still lead to \"aha\"-moments. DataCamp have been creating cheat sheets, infographics, and even a data science periodic table - which you see below -, but we know that there are tons of visual guides over there that will help newbies and masters, from basic concepts to expert topics. \n",

Also here, you'll find a lot of resources to help you to get started. Take a look at the following list:\n",

To give you a hand in this tough decision, the creator of scikit-learn - one of the most used Python's library for machine learning - [created this cheat sheet](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/ ). By answer questions in this fluxogram, you'll be guided to the proper estimator for your model.\n",
